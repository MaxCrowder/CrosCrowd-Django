# CrosCrowd-Django

This repo contains source code for the CrosCrowd Creative website using Django. The code is not production ready as the settings have not been configured for security.

CrosCrowd Creative is a business specializing in web development and content creation for small businesses looking to expand their online presence. Services include full-stack solutions as well as creative digital marketing campaigns.

As the company scales the website will need more functionality. To achieve that, I created a seperate repository for this website using Django. Django allows me to utilize different apps (Web Dev, Advertising, Consulting) to properly document and search for seperate projects as well as securely store customer information.
